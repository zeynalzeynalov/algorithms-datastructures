# Maximum sum BST in a binary tree problem solution:

Leetcode: https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-sum-bst-in-binary-tree/description/

Given a binary tree root, return the maximum sum of all keys of any sub-tree which is also a BST(`binary search trees`).

**Assume a BST is defined as follows:**

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with the keys less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with the keys greater than the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be BST(`binary search trees`).
